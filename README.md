- This site is a crowdsourced list of projects related to COVID-19 contact tracing using smartphones.
- The goal of contact tracing is to identify the contacts of people who have tested positive for COVID-19 and to advise them to self-quarantine.
- Large scale, highly accurate contact tracing could control the spread of epidemics and reduce the need for societal lockdowns.
